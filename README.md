C++ is a middle-level programming language. C++ runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various version of UNIX. 

## Why to Learn C++
C++ is a must for students and working professionals to become a great software engineer. I will list down some of the key advantage of learning C++:
* C++ is very close to hardware, so you get a chance to work at a low level gives you lot of control in terms of memory management, better performance and finally a robust software development.
* C++ programming gives you a clear understanding about Object Oriented Programming. You will understand low level implementation of polymorphism when you will implement virtual tables and virtual table pointers, or dynamic type identification.
* C++ really teaches you the difference between compiler, linker and loader, different data types, storage classes, variable types their scopes etc.
